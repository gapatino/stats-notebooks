When you are done click \"shift\" + \"enter\".  \n",

To run the code inside a code cell you'll need to hover on the top left corner of the box, and when the empty square brackets change to a \"play\" sign just click on it (alternatively: click on the code cell and then click \"shift\" + \"enter\"), this will make the outcome of the code to appear underneath the cell.  \n",
